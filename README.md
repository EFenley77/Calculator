# Calculator

## About
This project was around using gen AI to create a calculator. The proccess started by creating 10 sketches of what the UI could look like for the calculator. It had to include all the numbers and all the basic functions that you would expect to see on a regular calculator. This calculator is basic however it uses fun UI to make using a calculator a little more fun.

## Lessons Learned
Through this process Claude AI was giving me some issues with internal server issues. Which forced me to go and try some other tools like Chat GPT and Gemini. Though they were not giving the results I was hoping for and were a little clunky when it came to obtaining the code for the calculator. Eventually, though, Claude started working again for me and I was able to get what I wanted. It was intersesting to go back and forth between the gen AI tools and see their different functions and capabilities.
